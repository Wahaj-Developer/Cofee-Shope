This is my first website for a coffee shop, built using the foundational web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The basic structure of the website is created using HTML, which includes four main sections: Home, About, Menu, and Contact. Each section is designed to provide users with essential information about the coffee shop, its offerings, and how to get in touch. The website is not only functional but also visually appealing, thanks to the use of CSS for styling and responsiveness. Additionally, JavaScript is used to enhance the user experience, particularly for mobile users. <br>

HTML Structure<br>
The website’s structure is built with HTML, which serves as the backbone of the project. The four sections—Home, About, Menu, and Contact—are carefully organized to ensure easy navigation. The Home section welcomes visitors and provides a brief introduction to the coffee shop. The About section shares the story behind the coffee shop, its values, and what makes it unique. The Menu section displays the variety of coffee and other items available, while the Contact section includes essential details like the shop’s location, phone number, and a contact form for inquiries.<br>

CSS Styling and Responsiveness<br>
CSS plays a crucial role in making the website visually appealing and user-friendly. I focused on creating a clean and modern design that reflects the cozy and inviting atmosphere of a coffee shop. The color palette, typography, and layout were carefully chosen to create a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing experience. Additionally, the website is fully responsive, meaning it adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, whether viewed on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device. This ensures that all users, regardless of the device they use, can enjoy a smooth and consistent browsing experience.<br>

JavaScript for Interactivity<br>
To enhance the website’s functionality, I incorporated a small amount of JavaScript. One of the key features I implemented is a menu button for mobile users. When the screen size is reduced, the navigation bar collapses into a hamburger menu icon. Clicking this icon reveals the navigation options, making it easy for mobile users to access the different sections of the website. This feature improves the overall usability of the site, especially for visitors using smartphones or tablets.<br>

User Experience and Design<br>
The primary goal of this project was to create a website that is not only functional but also enjoyable to use. By combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I was able to build a platform that is both visually appealing and easy to navigate. The responsive design ensures that the website looks great on any device, while the interactive elements, such as the mobile menu button, enhance the user experience. The website’s design reflects the warm and welcoming ambiance of a coffee shop, making it an inviting space for visitors to explore.
